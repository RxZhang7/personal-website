                <h2>Welcome to My Website!</h2>
                <p>I am a motivated junior at Northeastern University majoring in Data Science. My academic background has given me a strong foundation in statistical analysis, machine learning, and programming, with proficiency in Python, C++, and JavaScript.</p>
                
                <p>I was actively involved in several projects during my college years that enhanced my technical and analytical skills. I was engaged in the development of a website which enables companies to review and screen resumes efficiently. This familiarized me with the use of APIs and the management of databases. I was also involved in a project to perform machine learning analysis on League of Legends game data, which enhanced my understanding of data cleaning and predictive modeling.</p>
                
                <p>Besides studies, my interests are tasting delicious food and playing video games. I have traveled to most of the cities in China such as Xi'an, Chengdu, Xinjiang, and Yunnan to enjoy their food. For gaming, I am a big fan of the FIFA series. I started playing from FIFA20 to EAFC25 now.</p>
                
                <p>I am always eager to explore new challenges to improve my problem solving and analytical skills. With a solid foundation in data science and a passion for applying technology to solve practical problems, I strive to constantly grow and innovate. This is a good platform for us to communicate and learn from each other, I hope you can find something interesting in my project and welcome to contact me anytime to discuss.</p>
