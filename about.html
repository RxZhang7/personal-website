                    <h3>Video Games</h3>
                    <p>I'm not a person who always socializes, so I spend a lot of time on games. I've played some mobile games, PC games, console games like CS1.6, The Witcher 3, Batman series, GTA V, and so on. But after playing a lot of single-player and online games, I found my favorite is the FIFA series of soccer games.</p>
                    <p>I've had a great interest in soccer since I was a kid, and I was a member of my school's soccer team. However, as my study load increased, I had less time to play. While I still played soccer occasionally, gaming provided me another way to stay connected to my passion. The most attractive part of FIFA games is the Ultimate Team mode, where I can build my own team, customize tactics, and compete with other players. This game not only reflects my love for soccer but also gives me a sense of accomplishment.</p>

                    <h3>Exploring Food & Travel</h3>
                    <p>One of my greatest interests is exploring food. Many factors influence the food habits of different regions, such as weather, traditions, and religious beliefs. Therefore, the cuisine of a region often represents its culture.</p>
                    <p>I live in Xi'an, China, a city known for its diverse cuisine, especially its noodles. Since childhood, I have eaten more than five different types of noodle dishes. Other regions also have distinct cuisines, such as hot pot in Sichuan, stir-fried meat in Hunan, and big plate chicken in Xinjiang. Exploring food is not just about satisfying my taste buds but also about experiencing the customs and culture of different regions.</p>
